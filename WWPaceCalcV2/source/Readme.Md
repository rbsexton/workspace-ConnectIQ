# WWPace Calculator, version 2

This data field calculates a grade-adjusted pace.

The formula is average speed + ( feet climbed/miles)/25 

This formula has reasonably good predictive power.   A rider who
averages 16mph on flat terrain would be expected to average 12mph 
on a  century with 10k feet of climing.  

## Enhancements in version two.

Version two calculated your pace over the last hours in addition to the entire ride.   This can give you a sense of ride pace over the course of a longer event.

The Data field rotates between:
- Entire Ride
- Last Hour
- Last 2 Hours
- Last 4 Hours
- Last 8 Hours
- Last 24 Hours
