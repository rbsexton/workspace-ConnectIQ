# WWPace Calculator, version 2

This data field calculates grade-adjusted pace in Miles per hour.

The formula is average speed + ( feet climbed/miles)/25 

This formula has reasonably good predictive power.   A rider who
averages 16mph on flat terrain would expect to average 12mph 
on a century with 10k feet of climing.  

## Version 2

Version two calculates your pace over the last hours in addition to the entire ride.  After one hour of ride time, it will display your pace over the last hour, after two hours pace over the last 2 hours, etc.    Last hours displays update 

The Data field rotates between:
- Entire Ride
- Last Hour   Update: every minute
- Last 2 Hours   Update: every two minutes
- Last 4 Hours   Update: every four minutes
- Last 8 Hours   Update: every eight minutes
- Last 24 Hours  Update: every 24 minutes
