This data field calculates your 'Time in the Bank' or 'Time in Hand' (minutes) while you ride.

Time in hand is the control closing time (for a control right where you are) minus your elapsed time.  Positive numbers mean you are ahead of schedule.

This calculator implements the ACP rules, with allowances for the extra finish time for 200k and 400k events (10 and 20 extra minutes, respectively). 

Caveats 
- If you start your ride before or after the official ride time you must make adjustments.
For example, if you start 5 minutes late you must finish with at least 5 minutes in the bank.
- This calculator will give you time credit for distance ridden off-route.
- If your event is longer than an ACP distance, this calculator can give you false hope.   For best results, estimate your ride time for the extra distance and factor that in.   

As is usual, no warranties are made or implied.  If you're riding very close to the close times, you probably shouldn't be relying upon this app.

When in doubt, consult your brevet card!
