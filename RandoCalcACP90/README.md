This data field calculates your 'Time in the Bank' or 'Time in Hand' (minutes) while you ride.

This is the control closing time (for a control right where you are) minus your elapsed time.

Positive numbers mean you are ahead of schedule.

Caveats 
- If you start your ride before or after the official ride time you must make adjustments.
For example, if you start 5 minutes late you must finish with at least 5 minutes in the bank.
- This calculator doesn't know anything about your route - it will give you credit for distance
ridden off-route.

ACP Rules actually give you a little more time for 200km and 400km events - you get an additional 10 and 20 minutes,
respectively above the number calculated. When in doubt, consult your brevet card!

This data field uses the ACP-90 hour rules as described by RUSA (0-600km:15kph, 600-1000km:11.4kph, 1000-1300:13.3kph).
